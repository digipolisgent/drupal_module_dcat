Provides a default landing page for each dataset if there is none provided.

This module consists out of two views to display a landing page for the datasets that don't have one.
You can view this on dataset/1/detail.

If you use the custom fieldformatter on the landing page field, it will automatically be replaced with a link to the
custom landing page if none is provided in the dataset entity.

If you enable the stark theme, it will be used to display this landing page, this way there is a clear difference
between your site and the generated landing page.
